This code is to reconstruct or interpolate from a set of scattered data (spatially located on a polar grid lines)
I used a lena image to generate the scattered data and used a b-spline interpolation scheme to reconstruct.

Install latest ITK (preferred 4.11.0)
Install Git or Tortoise git for source control (option)
Install latest cmake

Generate the visual studio project using the CMakeList.txt included in this folder
Preferred compilier VC14.0
